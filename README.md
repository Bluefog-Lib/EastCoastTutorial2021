# EastCoastTutorial2021

The main tutorials are in the following two jupyter notebooks under the tutorial directory.

* Part 1: tutorial/Parallel-and-Distributed-Optimization.ipynb
* Part 2: tutorial/Decentralized-Optimization.ipynb

To run these two notebooks, you have to install [`BlueFog`](https://github.com/Bluefog-Lib/bluefog) library first. Please follow the installation guide [here](https://bluefog-lib.github.io/bluefog/install.html). For users who work on a Unix-based system and do not need GPU support, you can simply follow our setup steps in [github action](https://github.com/ybc1991/EastCoastTutorial2021/blob/main/.github/workflows/notebook_test.yml).
